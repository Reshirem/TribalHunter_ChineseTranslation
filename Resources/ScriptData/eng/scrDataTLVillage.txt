		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance14": "I'm a gluttony demoness who has been around for longer than most civilizations have existed - put together!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance15": "I'm not even from this dimension and Sugar isn't even my real name.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance16": "My true name is incomprehensible to most mortals.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance17": "Really?",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance18": "What are you doing here of all places, then?",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance19": "The same reason I've stated before.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance2": "我以前从来没见过一次, 但我在这附近见过好几次.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance20": "I come here every year to watch the eating contest and chose to host it this time.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance21": "I'm a gluttony demoness; I'm drawn to the over-eating and gluttony of mortals.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance22": "Well... as long as you arent trying to devour the island I guess you're welcome.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance23": "No worries.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance24": "I know when I'm outclassed anyways.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance25": "Sure I can eat, but I can't fight my way out of a paper bag.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance26": "The villagers brought me up to speed on your current endeavors.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance27": "Ahh I see.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance28": "Well that's reassuring.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance29": "Trust me.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance3": "你是什么东西?",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance30": "I may be a gluttony demoness, but there are WAY worse out there.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance31": "I'm practically a saint compared to the average demon!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance4": "你是不是某种恶魔?",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance5": "恶魔!?",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance6": "为什么，这太荒谬了!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance7": "你怎么会这么想?",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance8": "不要说我的角，因为你有一双比我更大的角!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappearance9": "只是一点直觉.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappetite1": "You really can eat that much?",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappetite10": "Uhh...",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappetite2": "Even more than me?",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappetite3": "That and more.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappetite4": "That paltry amount you ate during the contest?",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappetite5": "That's barely an afternoon snack to me.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappetite6": "Maybe I ought to go back to that shark's food stand and buy out his entire stock.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappetite7": "That'll put some much needed meat back on my bones.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappetite8": "I mean, just look at me!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarappetite9": "I'm barely chubby!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarhosting1": "Like I said, I normally only come to watch.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarhosting10": "I might not look like it right now, but there is no one who could ever beat me in an eating contest, ever.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarhosting11": "I only look smaller than I normally do right now because of how long of a trip it was to get here.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarhosting12": "Winning every year would be boring, so I prefer to watch and cheer from the sidelines.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarhosting13": "If the usual host doesn't come back next year, maybe I'll step up to the hosting plate again!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarhosting2": "The guy who normally hosts it each year left the island.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarhosting3": "I couldn't bear the thought of the contest not happening, so I took charge this year.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarhosting4": "Why don't you join the contest?",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarhosting5": "I'm sure someone else from the village would have hosted.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarhosting6": "BWAHAHAHAHAHA!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarhosting7": "Oh man, that's a good one.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarhosting8": "Kid, I'll let you in on a secret.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarhosting9": "If I ever participated, no one would win, ever.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarposteventA1": "Woah, you're... not dead!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarposteventA10": "Huh... I think I might pass.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarposteventA11": "I'm not sure I'm capable of doing any better than I did.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarposteventA12": "Hmm... After that showing, I think you're the best candidate to do so.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarposteventA13": "Your form is different from the others, maybe you can find a way to support more weight.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarposteventA14": "I've seen some extreme eaters on my visits here, I'm sure someone has some secret tricks up their sleeves.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarposteventA15": "Alright, I'll ask around.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarposteventA2": "So the villagers were right when they said you'd be back!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarposteventA3": "Did that... hurt?",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarposteventA4": "I'm a doll so... It doesn't really hurt...",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarposteventA5": "It does feel a little weird, though.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarposteventA6": "Ah I see.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarposteventA7": "Well, I do have some good news for you.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarposteventA8": "Since the contest remained a four-way tie, the village agreed to host a rematch.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarposteventA9": "No one met the specifications of consumption to win, so you have another shot!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarposteventB1": "Hey, great job out there, Munch!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarposteventB2": "I haven't seen anyone put away that much food at once since, well, myself!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarposteventB3": "So, what are you up to now?",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarpreeventA1": "Hey, Munch!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarpreeventA2": "Are you ready to compete in the contest?",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarpreeventB1": "Hmm... I see you've obtained the edge you need...",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarpreeventB2": "Very well, are you ready to give it another go?",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarpreeventC1": "Sorry Munch, you don't look ready to overcome the rematch yet...",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarpreeventC2": "Can't be traumatizing people repeatedly, can we?",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarpreeventC3": "Go ask the villagers about it. They may be able to help!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarpreeventC4": "Come back once you have the edge you need!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugartruename1": "So if Sugar is your nickname... what's your real one?",
		"TLdiagYCHsugartruename2": "Glozigmanvraagryliknost Sukashivostserimus Katareipatatorokugol Tanasigdintuklamasinghaha.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugartruename3": "Roughly translated, it means: 'She who can devour an entire universe, and yet still be able to consume another'.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugartruename4": "Pretty cool, huh?",
		"TLdiagYCHsugartruename5": "Err... that was quite an earful.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarvillagerA1": "You okay, Munch?",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarvillagerA2": "You're looking a little thin. You ought to eat more.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarvillagerB1": "Hey, Munch!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarvillagerB2": "Looking good there!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarvillagerC1": "Nice, very nice.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarvillagerC2": "That's a good look for you!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarvillagerD1": "Mmmmm...",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarvillagerD2": "I wish everyone followed by your example, Munch!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarwhatnow1": "What are you going to do now?",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarwhatnow2": "Well, normally it's true that I bounce from this dimension after the contest is over.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarwhatnow3": "But I've been asking around the village about you.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarwhatnow4": "I do think it's great you're here to help out the village.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarwhatnow5": "I guess I'll stick around long enough to see what happens.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarwhatnow6": "I can't help you though, my body is too fragile for real combat.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarwhatnow7": "Best I can do is a little sumo for self-defense.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarwhatnow8": "But hey! You have my support, for what it's worth.",
		"TLdiagYCHsunblazeA1": "Hello, fellow devourer.",
		"TLdiagYCHsunblazeatingcontest1": "Hey, you did a great job in that contest!",
		"TLdiagYCHsunblazeatingcontest2": "Wait a minute...",
		"TLdiagYCHsunblazeatingcontest3": "So that WAS an eating contest...",
		"TLdiagYCHsunblazeatingcontest4": "Makes sense considering everything was free.",
		"TLdiagYCHsunblazeatingcontest5": "I'm glad I stopped eating... last time I ate like that I grew so big that I couldnt fit into my cave.",
		"TLdiagYCHsunblazeatingcontest6": "While my bottom was hanging outside the entrance, someone painted a silly face on it.",
		"TLdiagYCHsunblazeatingcontest7": "Oops, that must have been embarrassing!",
		"TLdiagYCHsunblazecouldwin1": "I'm curious...",
		"TLdiagYCHsunblazecouldwin2": "Could you have won if you knew it was a contest?",
		"TLdiagYCHsunblazecouldwin3": "I'm sure I could have.",
		"TLdiagYCHsunblazecouldwin4": "But you know how it goes, a giant array of food is enough of a reward.",
		"TLdiagYCHsunblazecouldwin5": "Shame I can't demonstrate my full capacity.",
		"TLdiagYCHsunblazecouldwin6": "Hehe. I bet you could eat a mountain if you wanted to.",
		"TLdiagYCHsunblazewisdom1": "Do you have any dragon wisdom to tell?",
		"TLdiagYCHsunblazewisdom2": "Remember: we dragons are walking talking fire hazards.",
		"TLdiagYCHsunblazewisdom3": "Next time you visit one of us, bring mashmallows!",
		"TLdiagYCHsunblazewisdom4": "Oh hey, I can make some fire too!",
		"TLdiagYCHsunblazewisdom5": "But... was that supposed to be wisdom?",
		"TLdiagYCHsunblazewisdom6": "*snickers*",
		"TLdiagYCHsunblazewisdom7": "Depends on your point of view.",
		"TLdiagcafeabout1": "Can you tell me about the restraunt?",
		"TLdiagcafeabout2": "Not to toot my own horn, but my restaurant is definitely the talk of the town!",
		"TLdiagcafeabout3": "We have a small menu, but it has all of the island favorites.",
		"TLdiagcafeabout4": "Plenty of guests also come through here, so stay and enjoy the atmosphere!",
		"TLdiagcafeabout5": "And if you want to meet different people you can always kill some time at the bar with my specialty tea. It's free!",
		"TLdiagcafefoodbuffs1": "Can your food give me any powers?",
		"TLdiagcafefoodbuffs2": "They can indeed.",
		"TLdiagcafefoodbuffs3": "Food has a way of strengthening the body in different ways.",
		"TLdiagcafefoodbuffs4": "Many of my meals focus on braving the wilds.",
		"TLdiagcafefoodbuffs5": "That extra layer of protection is important on the hunt.",
		"TLdiagcafefoodbuffs6": "You'll also gain some Spirit Points, so it's always worth it to stop in for a bite!",
		"TLdiagcafefoodbuffs7": "However... Remember that you can only have one food effect at a time, and it will wear off if you fall in combat!",
		"TLdiagcafeteatime1": "One tea coming right up!",
		"TLdiageldermushcapA1": "Mushrooms no longer affecting you, hmm?",
		"TLdiageldermushcapA2": "It sounds like you need to do a physical ritual to stretch out more.",
		"TLdiageldermushcapA3": "The slimes are good at that... The king of the caverns should have the answer you need.",
		"TLdiageldermushcapB1": "Mushrooms no longer affecting you, hmm?",
		"TLdiageldermushcapB2": "It sounds like you need to do a physical ritual to stretch out more.",
		"TLdiageldermushcapB3": "What about the bountiful harvest festival?",
		"TLdiageldermushcapB4": "A woman on the coast of the north beach looked like she was recruiting!",
		"TLdiageldermushcapBB4": "A woman here in the upper cliffs of the village looked like she was recruiting!",
		"TLdiageldermushcapC1": "Mushrooms no longer affecting you, hmm?",
		"TLdiageldermushcapC2": "It sounds like you need special training to reach your hidden potential.",
		"TLdiageldermushcapC3": "A hidden dojo lies in the snowy mountains. That's where you should go.",
		"TLdiagelderpotion1": "Oh ho ho, an eating contest?",
		"TLdiagelderpotion2": "I know something that might help your eating power become stronger.",
		"TLdiagelderpotion3": "Here's a recipe for an ancient potion that was used to encourage growth.",
		"TLdiagelderpotion4": "It's made with Popper Mushrooms and it can help you to eat more!",
		"TLdiagelderpotion5": "Oh wow, thanks!",
		"TLdiageldervillager1": "Why hello, young one.",
		"TLdiageldervillager2": "How can I be of service?",
		"TLdiagelderpowers1": "Refreshing yourself are you?",
		"TLdiagelderpowers2": "Consuming food or defeated enemies will grant you stored fat.",
		"TLdiagelderpowers3": "Usable items such as milk will grant you this as well.",
		"TLdiagelderpowers4": "You can use this as a resource to shoot fire, or explosive eggs!",
		"TLdiagelderpowers5": "You can also convert this into healing by sitting.",
		"TLdiagelderpowers6": "Using your fire while seated will rapidly consume fat for quick healing in a pinch!",
		"TLdiagelderpowers7": "It's very important to manage your resource and internal capacity, though.",
		"TLdiagelderpowers8": "Maintaining safe levels will keep you stable!",
		"TLdiaggrannyrestraunt1": "Welcome, ancient one.",
		"TLdiaggrannyrestraunt2": "What can I do for you?",
		"TLdiaggrannyrestrauntfinal1": "Ahh... come at the hour of peril for your last meal?",
		"TLdiaggrannyrestrauntfinal2": "The final meal before battle can determine your performance!",
		"TLdiagkeyeatcontestpot1": "You look ready for your secret weapon.",
		"TLdiagkeyeatcontestpot2": "I have it crafted and ready for you!",
		"TLdiagkeyeatcontestpot3": "Hope that ends up working out for you!",
		"TLdiagkeyeatcontestpot4": "Show em who's boss!",
		"TLdiagkeyeatingcontest1": "An eating contest?",
		"TLdiagkeyeatingcontest10": "Maybe the village elder knows about it!",
		"TLdiagkeyeatingcontest11": "He seems to know a lot about these kinds of things.",
		"TLdiagkeyeatingcontest12": "Alright, I'll go ask.",
		"TLdiagkeyeatingcontest2": "...",
		"TLdiagkeyeatingcontest3": "......",
		"TLdiagkeyeatingcontest4": "Hmmm...",
		"TLdiagkeyeatingcontest5": "I have heard of a potion that makes you really hungry after drinking it...",
		"TLdiagkeyeatingcontest6": "But I have no idea how to make it.",
		"TLdiagkeyeatingcontest7": "...",
		"TLdiagkeyeatingcontest8": "Fuahh... theres gotta be something...",
		"TLdiagkeyeatingcontest9": "Oh, I know!",
		"TLdiagkeyhivegate1": "Oh, you mean that stone door?",
		"TLdiagkeyhivegate2": "I've seen it.",
		"TLdiagkeyhivegate3": "It has a rune port on it.",
		"TLdiagkeyhivegate4": "Most runes will work, but most have been lost with time.",
		"TLdiagkeyhivegate5": "Is there any possibility of finding one?",
		"TLdiagkeyhivegate6": "I think your only chance of finding one will be to go to the old kingdom on the eastern side of the island.",
		"TLdiagkeyhivegate7": "A great wizard resided there during its prime. She ended up being a pretty big artifact hoarder, though.",
		"TLdiagkeyhivegate8": "The kingdom was decimated by some unknown cause, leaving it a literal ghost town.",
		"TLdiagkeyhivegate9": "Based on that, I would assume that same wizard hoarded a rune or two. Look for the tower.",
		"keymunchsq1": "Hey Key, do you have a device that can detect food? I've been pretty hungry lately...",
		"keymunchsq2": "Uh, no... but I can order some if you'd like on my phone.",
		"keymunchsq3": "Whaaa?! You can call food to you just like that?!",
		"keymunchsq4": "Yeah! The birdmen are pretty quick on delivering things from what I've seen.",
		"keymunchsq5": "Wow! Get me tons of food! Enough to feed the entire island!",
		"keymunchsq6": "Munch... that's gonna get expensive real quick... Deliveries don't come cheap you know!",
		"keymunchsq7": "Pretty please? I'm starving!",
		"keymunchsq8": "Alright you chonky lizard, but I'm only getting you a family sized meal.",
		"keymunchsq9": "Make it a few dozen, or you'll be smothered between my pecs all day!",
		"keymunchsq10": "WHEEZE!!! Alright Alright you win!!!",
		"TLdiagkeypotcontest1": "Any luck with the elder?",
		"TLdiagkeypotcontest10": "Once you have that sorted out, talk to me again and I'll make it!",
		"TLdiagkeypotcontest11": "Alright, I'll check back when I'm ready.",
		"TLdiagkeypotcontest2": "He gave me a recipe that he thinks may help.",
		"TLdiagkeypotcontest3": "What?",
		"TLdiagkeypotcontest4": "Let me see here...",
		"TLdiagkeypotcontest5": "Oh man!",
		"TLdiagkeypotcontest6": "I can totally make this no problem!",
		"TLdiagkeypotcontest7": "It does appear that there is a condition though...",
		"TLdiagkeypotcontest8": "You need to have a certain fullness threshold for it to even work.",
		"TLdiagkeypotcontest9": "You'll need to have a max capacity of at least 650.",
		"TLdiagkeyupgrade1": "You know, my tent is pretty adequate but...",
		"TLdiagkeyupgrade2": "I think I'd prefer an actual building to store my wares.",
		"TLdiagkeyupgrade3": "If you'd be willing to invest, I'll open more purchasing options!",
		"TLdiagkeyupgrade4": "I think 3000 gold is all I'd need for the permitting and what not.",
		"TLdiagkeyupgrade5": "Hmm... that sounds beneficial to both of us.",
		"TLdiagkeyupgrade6": "Let me think about it...",
		"TLdiagkeyupgradeAA5": "Hmm... that sounds beneficial to both of us.",
		"TLdiagkeyupgradeAA6": "I'm a little short right now but I'll consider saving some up!",
		"TLdiagkeyupgradeno1": "That's alright.",
		"TLdiagkeyupgradeno2": "But do consider it, won't you?",
		"TLdiagkeyupgradeyes1": "Heck yeah, time to move up in the world!",
		"TLdiagkeyupgradeyes2": "I'll start construction and expand my catalogue for the next time you visit the village!",
		"TLdiagkeyvillager1": "Hey, Munch.",
		"TLdiagkeyvillager2": "What can I do for you?",
		"TLdiagkeyvillagerF1": "Hmm... Preparing for a final showdown eh?",
		"TLdiagkeyvillagerF2": "I'll tell ya what... Since my business rides on your success...",
		"TLdiagkeyvillagerF3": "Feel free to take what you want! It's on the house!",
		"TLdiagkeyvillagerF4": "You can pay me back by beating the spirit!",
		"TLdiagshamanchatA1": "Ahh, welcome to the village!",
		"TLdiagshamanchatA2": "You are here to save us, and we are here to guide you!",
		"TLdiagshamanchatA3": "Let your reincarnation be most beneficial to all of us, guardian!",
		"TLdiagshamanchatB1": "Ahh, greetings Munch!",
		"TLdiagshamanchatB2": "How can this rickety old shaman aid you?",
		"TLdiagshamanchatC1": "Ha ha ha!",
		"TLdiagshamanchatC2": "That Boarus stood no chance!",
		"TLdiagshamanchatC3": "I knew he would be a mere inconvenience to you!",
		"TLdiagshamanchatD1": "The slime king has been a recurring obstacle to those seeking power here.",
		"TLdiagshamanchatD2": "He is both timeless and recurring, granting challenge to all who wish it!",
		"TLdiagshamanchatE1": "We have heard stories about the great Ocean Sapphire from our ancestors.",
		"TLdiagshamanchatE2": "To think it was in the deepest depths of the caverns this whole time!",
		"TLdiagshamanchatF1": "Quick on your feet! I like that!",
		"TLdiagshamanchatF2": "Not many could stand shoulder to shoulder with the queen of the sea!",
		"TLdiagshamanchatG1": "Ahh... Darkdread is tough indeed.",
		"TLdiagshamanchatG2": "Remember... Even though you're a great guardian, you are not infallible.",
		"TLdiagshamanchatG3": "I have faith you will defeat him in due time.",
		"TLdiagshamanchatH1": "I hereby name you KING OF SPIRITS!",
		"TLdiagshamanchatH2": "That giant ghost didn't stand a chance against out great guardian!",
		"TLdiagshamanchatI1": "Oof...",
		"TLdiagshamanchatI2": "Stingers make me queasy...",
		"TLdiagshamanchatI3": "You are very tenacious to have taken on the hive!",
		"TLdiagsisterchatfinalday1": "Looks like we're in quite a doozy...",
		"TLdiagsisterchatfinalday2": "Guess this is your final opportunity to show us what you can do.",
		"TLdiagsisterchatA1": "Hmm... So you're the guardian spirit, eh?",
		"TLdiagsisterchatA2": "Well, hopefully you can live up to your legacy.",
		"TLdiagsisterchatA3": "I'm not easy to impress so... hop to it.",
		"TLdiagsisterchatB1": "Heya.",
		"TLdiagsisterchatB2": "Did you save the island yet?",
		"TLdiagsisterchatB3": "No?",
		"TLdiagsisterchatC1": "Hmm... You beat Boarus, huh?",
		"TLdiagsisterchatC2": "I guess he wasn't as tough as we thought.",
		"TLdiagsisterchatD1": "The slime king was always pretty spineless.",
		"TLdiagsisterchatD2": "But I guess that's one more threat down.",
		"TLdiagsisterchatE1": "So the Ocean Sapphire was guarded by a crystal golem huh?",
		"TLdiagsisterchatE2": "I guess a sharp, solid giant is more difficult to deal with than slime.",
		"TLdiagsisterchatF1": "Hmm... I cannot deny Killsha's abilites.",
		"TLdiagsisterchatF2": "A sailor's life is a tough one, and beating her means you MUST be pretty tough!",
		"TLdiagsisterchatG1": "Lord Dread is an absolute menace.",
		"TLdiagsisterchatG2": "I say this sincerely, but I never expected you to beat him.",
		"TLdiagsisterchatG3": "I do have faith that you'll be able to as you grow in strength, though.",
		"TLdiagsisterchatH1": "You beat up a giant ghost???",
		"TLdiagsisterchatH2": "That's impressive from merely a scientific standpoint!",
		"TLdiagsisterchatI1": "Defeating a queen bee means you also beat an army as well.",
		"TLdiagsisterchatI2": "...Nice.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardA1": "You're really a legendary guardian?",
		"TLdiagvillageguardA2": "You should have no problem helping us deal with the pig onslaught, then.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardA3": "They inhabit the entire area to the east.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardB1": "The pigs constantly pose a threat to the east.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardB2": "Deal with them, whenever possible.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardC1": "Now that the pig threat is minimized... we sense trouble down below.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardC2": "The mines are located at the fork in the piglands... please check it out.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardD1": "We have received word of a powerful foe elsewhere in the mines.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardD2": "It emanates some sort of magical energy.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardE1": "The caverns are secure. The beach is next... riddled with pirates.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardE2": "You can be taken there by Gordo to the west of the village.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardF1": "The pirates have been weakened... and we have received word of Darkdread being spotted in the Shadowlands.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardF2": "Subdue him... East of the beach, and through the jungle.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardG1": "Darkdread will be defeated in time... For now, we have identified a new threat...",
		"TLdiagvillageguardG2": "At the tower to the east of the Shadowlands is a very powerful ghost that has a magical item we seek...",
		"TLdiagvillageguardH1": "There appears to be a large hive located near the mountains...",
		"TLdiagvillageguardH2": "While not an immediate threat, it could transform into one.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardI1": "The only threat that remains is Darkdread...",
		"TLdiagvillageguardI2": "His castle is located at the top of the mountains... Good luck...",
		
		"TLdiagvillageguardfinal1": "I guess this is your purpose.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardfinal2": "The shaman has great faith that you will prevail.",
		"TLdiagtipvillage1": "Want to view some of my tips?",
		"TLdiagtorialtar1": "Ah, Munch!",
		"TLdiagtorialtar2": "I have heeded your call!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarchatvillage1": "This here is the ancient village of the island.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarchatvillage2": "It is home to us and the source of the island's wisdom!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarchatwatchyourstep1": "This is the heart of the Piglands.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarchatwatchyourstep2": "It was given this name by the pigs during their conquest, of course.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarchatwatchyourstep3": "This area is controlled by rogues and bandits alike!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarPL41": "The Piglands branches toward the Great Mountain here.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarPL42": "It is both majestic and dangerous.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarPL43": "I doubt the pigs were able to venture near it!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarpigmines1": "These caverns were formed by the island's latent energy.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarpigmines2": "Seen merely as treasure, these gems are worth far more spiritually!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarpigmines3": "It seems the pigs do not understand that, though.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarpighideoutA1": "This dense area is where the king of pigs Boarus resides.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarpighideoutA2": "It is intended to be hidden and out of sight, but Boarus' bravado does a poor job of concealing it.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarpighideoutA3": "I mean think about it... you just walked right in!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarbeachresort1": "The northern beach is rife with relaxation.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarbeachresort2": "The pirates have made vacationing here near impossible though...",
		"TLdiagtorialtarbeachresort3": "At least this resort seems to be a sanctuary though!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarjungleB1": "The jungle bridges the land between the Beach and Shadowlands.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarjungleB2": "The farther in you go, the denser it becomes!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarjungleB3": "It seems even the pirates are wary of trekking too far in...",
		"TLdiagtorialtarhiveshrine1": "Very few know of this hive's existance...",
		"TLdiagtorialtarhiveshrine2": "A growing army, swelling in secrecy...",
		"TLdiagtorialtarhiveshrine3": "They must not be too happy to see you in here!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarghostcitypath1": "The Shadowlands was once a densely populated utopia.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarghostcitypath2": "A city far more advanced than the village in terms of architecture.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarghostcitypath3": "All that has come to an end, though...",
		"TLdiagtorialtarghostcitypath4": "I have only heard rumors, but they say the population eradicated itself in a mere day!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarghostcitypath5": "A whole city brought to complete ruin!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarcemetary1": "This is the central cemetery of the city.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarcemetary2": "It seems to reside deep in the city, close to the main structures and districts.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarcemetary3": "It gives me the heebie-jeebies...",
		"TLdiagtorialtarmount41": "This respite on the edge of the cliff provided a restful spot for many a traveler.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarmount42": "Many put their life on the line climbing this mountain...",
		"TLdiagtorialtarmount43": "This spot is a point of inspiration that proves it can be done!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarmount101": "Ahh we're nearing the peak!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarmount102": "The Serpent's Cavern is one of the last stretches to the top!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarmount141": "Ahh the foot of the castle!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarmount142": "It's probably pretty dangerous inside, so make sure you're stocked up on supplies!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarcastlebalc1": "Who knew the castle had its own shrine up here?",
		"TLdiagtorialtarcastlebalc2": "Oh wait, I did!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarcastlebalc3": "Royalty gets mail too!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillage1": "This village has existed for generations.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillage2": "The island itself used to be a very popular tourist destination.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillage3": "Merchants and travelers would pass through and bring a more eccentric vibe to this place!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillage4": "Unfortunately, selfishness has taken hold of the other factions here.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillage5": "It's difficult to trade and sustain a population now.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillage6": "But that's why you're here!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers1": "There aren't many permanent residents anymore...",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers10": "The guildmaster also creates all of our beautiful dyes.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers11": "She's out doing field research.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers11a": "I think she's finished most of her field research so she should be right up at the guild tent!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers12": "I think she was looking for special glowing crystals or something!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers13": "To-ri is our courier and transportation.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers14": "I don't know where he could have gone.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers15": "I haven't seen him in a few days... He must be in the Piglands somewhere, though.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers14a": "He has a house perched up on the western cliff.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers15a": "If you need to go somewhere fast, call him at the bird statue near the altar!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers16": "Gordo lives on the western beach and used to give water transportation to tourists.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers17": "I wish I knew how to get him to offer rides again...",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers17a": "You seemed to have inspired him to travel again! That's awesome!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers18": "Key is a wandering merchant that set up shop here in town.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers19": "I think you're acquainted with him already!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers20": "Sugar and Sunblaze are visitors.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers21": "They enjoyed the Bountiful Harvest Festival so much that they extended their vacation here!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers22": "Lastly theres that old lizard man...",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers23": "He showed up shortly after you came to be!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers2": "But we cherish those that we have!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers24": "He must be more than a mere drifter... Perhaps he knows more about you than us!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers25": "...",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers26": "And I think that covers the residents!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers3": "My family coordinates most of what the village does.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers4": "Grandpa is the head shaman, my brother runs the farm, and my sister handles construction.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers5": "Grandma runs our only restraunt.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers6": "She's usually out hunting and gathering in the Piglands.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers6a": "She decided to outsource some of the gathering work to the guards so she's now at the joint permanently!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers7": "Hmm... We also have a small artist's guild.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers8": "The artists enjoy painting helpful advice.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers9": "Ask them about it if you see them!",
		"TLdiagyisyaeatingcontest1": "That was quite the match!",
		"TLdiagyisyaeatingcontest2": "Sorry you couldnt stomach that last bite though...",
		"TLdiagyisyaeatingcontest3": "You've seen the contest before, right?",
		"TLdiagyisyaeatingcontest4": "Do you know any way I can gain an edge for the rematch?",
		"TLdiagyisyaeatingcontest5": "Hmm... Yeah...",
		"TLdiagyisyaeatingcontest6": "If I recall, there was a special solution competitors used in the past.",
		"TLdiagyisyaeatingcontest7": "I dont remember what it was called, but it was pretty hard to make.",
		"TLdiagyisyaeatingcontest8": "I think you would need to find a craftsman to do it. That goat guy seems pretty crafty!",
		"TLdiagyisyahivegate1": "Hmm... there's an ancient gate up there?",
		"TLdiagyisyahivegate2": "I've heard about old artifacts, but we at the tribe are pretty disconnected from the past.",
		"TLdiagyisyahivegate3": "Have you met anyone in that area? They would know more than us.",
		"TLdiagyisyameet1": "Wow, I can't believe you're real!",
		"TLdiagyisyameet2": "You look exactly like my old doll!",
		"TLdiagyisyameet3": "Thanks for summoning me!",
		"TLdiagyisyameet4": "I'll do my best to restore your village.",
		"TLdiagyisyameet5": "I'm so glad my granddad's effort wasn't in vain.",
		"TLdiagyisyameet6": "My name's Yisya, and I'll try to help you out as best I can!",
		"TLdiagyisyameet7": "I can make more dolls incase your current form falls apart!",
		"TLdiagyisychatA1": "Wow... I can still hardly believe you're real!",
		"TLdiagyisychatA2": "It's like a dream!",
		"TLdiagyisychatA3": "Feel free to ask me anything!",
		"TLdiagyisychatB1": "Hey, Munch!",
		"TLdiagyisychatB2": "How is the island treating you so far?",
		"TLdiagyisychatC1": "Hey, Munch!",
		"TLdiagyisychatC2": "I heard you gave Boarus quite the beating!",
		"TLdiagyisychatC3": "That will knock him down a few pegs!",
		"TLdiagyisychatD1": "Hey, Munch!",
		"TLdiagyisychatD2": "You're really living up to your fame!",
		"TLdiagyisychatD3": "I can't believe you managed to tame the king of slimes!",
		"TLdiagyisychatE1": "Hey, Munch!",
		"TLdiagyisychatE2": "Word's gotten around that you found the fabled Ocean Sapphire!",
		"TLdiagyisychatE3": "The pigs have been looking for that for awhile, but I guess you beat them to it!",
		"TLdiagyisychatF1": "Hey, Munch!",
		"TLdiagyisychatF2": "The pirates have been splintering off into smaller factions on the shores.",
		"TLdiagyisychatF3": "I'll assume you threw a wrench into their power structure, eh?",
		"TLdiagyisychatG1": "Hey, I felt your defeat to Lord Dread...",
		"TLdiagyisychatG2": "Keep your head up and keep moving!",
		"TLdiagyisychatG3": "The gifts you have will allow you to prevail, you just need to hone them more!",
		"TLdiagyisychatH1": "Hey Munch!",
		"TLdiagyisychatH2": "Now that you've subdued the Ghost Queen, the lost city will lay to rest.",
		"TLdiagyisychatH3": "Maybe it can be reinhabited one day...",
		"TLdiagyisychatI1": "Hey Munch!",
		"TLdiagyisychatI2": "I heard you faced off against a huge queen bee!",
		"TLdiagyisychatI3": "Didn't get stung too much, I hope!",
		"TLdiagyisyacaverns1": "Hmm... We've noticed disturbances coming from down below.",
		"TLdiagyisyacaverns2": "I think it's worth looking into.",
		"TLdiagyisyacaverns3": "There's an entrance to an old mine in the Piglands at the fork!",
		"TLdiagyisyacaverns4": "It might be blocked off... but you're more than capable of smashing in!",
		"TLdiagyisyacaverns5": "Could you go check it out?",
		"TLdiagyisychatfinal1": "It's great to have you back, Munch!",
		"TLdiagyisychatfinal2": "I was so worried we wouldn't see you again...",
		"TLdiagyisychatfinal3": "But my faith continues to deliver!",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalisland1": "The island has felt so weird since your summit with Darkdread...",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalisland2": "The blast afterwards threw us all for a loop!",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalisland3": "Yeah... the spirit wasn't happy with what I did in that seal room...",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalisland4": "I think she expected me to become the new seal.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalisland5": "What?!",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalisland6": "Well... I'm glad you didn't.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalisland7": "My grandpa saw something else in the cards for you.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalisland8": "He once told me that you would put the evil of the island at rest.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalisland9": "At first he didn't really understand the meaning... but I think he does now.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalplan1": "We've been planning for everything once the island takeover began by Darkdread.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalplan2": "Even now, that's no different.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalplan3": "If things go truly dire, we will get away!",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalplan4": "Hopefully escape won't be necessary.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalplan5": "Now that the island's full power is released, I must face it head on.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalplan6": "I know I can do this!",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalplan7": "We believe in you, Munch!",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit1": "We saw that wierd spirit lady blast from the castle with a ray of light!",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit2": "We thought you were toast for sure... but I saw you flicker through the air as we escaped.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit3": "Seeing your doll was actually reassuring...",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit4": "I knew your spirit must have escaped after the blast!",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit5": "Yeah... The energy up there was extremely intense.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit6": "Did you see where the spirit went?",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit7": "She flew into the sky and screamed!",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit8": "She seemed extremely angry... but also sad.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit9": "I have no idea what she's planning next...",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit10": "There was an extreme darkness hidden inside the castle.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit11": "She must be angry with me for freeing it...",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit12": "Somehow... me and grandpa know that freeing it was the right choice.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit13": "He receives the prophecies from the island itself... but always feels conflict.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit14": "Like the sealing by the ancient ones caused more harm than good.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit15": "The moment might feel dire... but it must be part of a greater plan...",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit16": "One that you're the star player in!",
